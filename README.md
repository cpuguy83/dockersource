This is a tool to get a list of image sources out of a Dockerfile.

It can also optionally run another program to add a "replace" directive to test out a feature I'm working on to replace images with a different source reference.

This tool only generates metadata that can be fed into other tools.
It is based on a lot of in progress work and is only here as a placeholder.
